Spatial Data Structures Simulation Program
==========================================

This program runs simulations of real-time 3D scenes with varying numbers of static and dynamic objects in order to measure the performance of different spatial data structures. It currently includes implementations of octrees and BSP trees. It was designed to allow additional data structures to be easily implemented.

This is a Mac OS X application written in Swift. It uses OpenGL for graphics rendering.

This application was developed by [Josh Beam](http://joshbeam.com/) and is distributed under the BSD-style license shown at the bottom of this file.
